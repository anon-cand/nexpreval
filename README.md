## To-Do

- [x] Think about your data structure
- [x] Create a bare bones working version.
- [x] Add logging, argument parsing and validations.
- [x] Separate parsing and data structure which is evaluated.
- [x] Is the design of ops and protocol class (Operations) Pythonic?
- [ ] Add unit tests. 
- [ ] Data Generator for unit test data
- [x] Dynamically build the operations map by importing all modules from folder?
- [x] Refactor to module and driver program
- [x] Convert operations to a package
- [ ] Introduce asynchronous processing of files
- [x] Separate evaluation of operation from operation
- [x] Operations can form a dependency graph. However these dependencies are independent and can be processed in parallel.
- [ ] Upload on github for continuous integration
- [x] Handling of large files (Pull-API/Memory Mapped files)
- [ ] Sphinx documentation
- [ ] Add continuous measurements
- [ ] Refactor to best practices. Check PEP8 conformance
- [ ] Create wheel files for package?
- [ ] Is the program able to handle overflows of numbers?
- [ ] Are the guidelines in Fluent Python / Zen of Python followed?
- [ ] Is the application conforming to TwelveFactors?
